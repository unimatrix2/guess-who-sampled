# Guess Who Sampled Game

Welcome to GWS game!
This game is inspired by modern music production techniques. In it, you have a
track that was made using a sample from another song, and your job is to
guess from which song the sample used inside the track came from!

The rules are simple:

You have 3 lives to win the game, and to win you have to go through all levels.

On the top, the level's track will be displayed, and if you want to, the YouTube
link by your right will take you to YouTube so you can listen to the full track.

You can listen to the sample for as many times as you want, but you can only miss
the answer 3 times, as each error will consume a life.

On the left, you have the play/stop control and your number of lives remaining
right below, so keep track of that!

On the right, you have all the 4 alternatives to select from, so you can always use
smart-pants tech and eliminate those less likely to be the answer on your mind.
